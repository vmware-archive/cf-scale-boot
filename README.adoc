= cf-scale-boot

Demonstrate application instance scaling on Cloud Foundry with this simple (one Groovy file, one HTML file) Spring Boot CLI application!

== Running Locally

* Install the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli[latest Spring Boot CLI].
* Run:

----
$ spring run app.groovy
----

== Running on Cloud Foundry

The application requires the latest version of the Java Buildpack, so we'll use that from GitHub.

----
$ spring grab app.groovy
$ cf push -m 512M -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack cf-scale-boot
----

== SCALE!

----
$ cf scale cf-scale-boot -i 1000
----

(_or some reasonable number for your CF cloud!_)

== What you get:
